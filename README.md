## General Information
- This project consists of analysing the reasons for the decline of the number of users using the bike sharing provider Boom Bikes.

## Goal
- The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model to analyse what variables influence the bike sharing system and how well those variables describe the bike demands.
- 
## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- MATLAB 
- NumPy
- Scikit Learn
- Statsmodel

## Conclusions
- The Model built can be used to analyse the trend in number of users and can be used to predict the number of users we can expect on a particular day according to the influencial parameters.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the need to minimize financial loss in bike sharing system.
